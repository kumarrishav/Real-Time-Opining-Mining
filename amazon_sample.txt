I need not to write anything. I am an iPhone fan ever since it launched in India. People who say its not worth the price - Please do not buy iPhone if you can not afford it. The product is nice and amazing like all other iPhones. Few features are amazing like 3D touch and photo Collection.

Amazing phone that sets new standards on consumer experience . Works like a dream and the icing on the cake is Siri . You can get Siri to any thing from opening apps to playing specific music, checking time. It is amazingly fast and easy to set up . With your earlier Apple phone backed up in icloud, it takes minutes before you are ready to go with the 6sAll backed up by Amazon's incredible service and delivery systems and prices  that always please. Buy it now and from Amazon.

Needs more applications to be compatible to unleash the real power behind the technology.Live photos is fun. The best improvement is on the fingerprint scanner which is like touch and go.Sometimes it actually unlocks by just a 1 sec touch without you meaning to.All in all an amazing phone. Well worth the buy.

Product looks and feels good in hand but the battery backup is pathetic. With only phone calls and no other applications installed, the battery lasts only 15-16 hours. I don't understand if it is my particular device which has issues or all 6s behave like this. I mean 50k₹ phone could not last a complete day is horrible. Anyone else who had same issue and was able to resolve it? Unfortunately my return window is closed and I can not return it anymore.Updated:- after nearly a month of using it, I have started loving it. The battery backup somehow has increased and now the standby is a little over a day which is good for me. Superbly designed o s and silky smooth interface, I am kinda loving it.

Experience of a 'Simple Average User
kumaran B
on 18 January 2016
Seller : Clouldtail ( Super Fast delivery - Genuine and Original Apple Sealed iPhone 6s )Before I start I would like to say that I am neither an Apple nor Android Fanboy .  I'm a simple customer who likes to get the worth for the 'Half Lakh' which is spent on a mobile phone and share my experience.Also Do NOT bother about people saying upon online purchase Genuinity and Warranty. Everything is applicable for the online purchase just as we buy in a store except that we get it for a very cheaper price ;-). I have purchased many many products from Amazon and all of them are genuine and their respective warranties are covered perfectly by the manufacturers. Even if there is an issue then Amazon refunds the entire 'immediately'. Just make sure to read the seller reviews and look for 'Amazon Fulfilled' Badge next to the price before making a purchase.Let's leave all the Fancy Terms that is used to describe the iPhone 6s like 3D touch, A9 and 7000 Series Aluminium Etc., The following are what I feel as a simple average user.- It is very easy to use. Just set it up and start using it.- I need not do things(fiddle with settings) to increase my user experience, The phone itself does that.- Absolutely no Lag or stutter at all. NEVER and NOT EVEN ONCE.- Everything is smooth and Faster.- The phone feels very strong and sturdy in hand.- Standby time is Fabulous ( when the phone is not used the battery barely reduces )- The Best camera ( I Love photography and own a DSLR, still my go to camera is always the iPhone ).- Super fast finger print sensor-It is blazing fast- Signal Quality is Very Good. Even at the weakest places there is no break in signals ( I move up and down in floors where all the other phones break up and sometimes I need to stay in one place to talk to people without their voice breaking).- Wifi (Range)picks up very good signal and loading of apps, page loading in browser and 3D touch loading is superb.- Outdoor brightness is Fantastic- Tough Front Glass ( I don't even have a screen protector on it-Just a spigen case that too because I carry the phone in hand all the time )- 3D Touch eases up lot of tasks by 'reducing' the purpose to go back and forth in pages and apps. It is very simple and easy to use. It works nicely on Amazon App Too :-)- I don't have to say anything about the looks because it is a piece of art rather than a device.( Watch Steve Job's old unveil video in youtube and you can see him looking at the iPhone as a baby). The iPhone is SEAMLESS. That's it.- Quick Reply ' I can respond to message and notifications without going to the specific application and after replying continue working on what I was doing before.- Apps ' this is one thing that makes me come back to the iPhone again and again. There is App for everything and the important thing is that everything works. No need to use third party Apps for whatever I want. There is a perfect blend of hardware and software. Apple checks each and every app and if it not coordinating with Apple hardware then the App won't be there.Limitation that I feel- Storage space ( 16 GB as a base model for a 'Half Lakh' Product, Seriously Apple ?!!! That too by the end of 2015)- iTunes for everything ( I do understand the security and stuff, but not having a folder management like android is hard because to quickly transfer stuff between non apple devices is hard ). The same ( transfer ) between Apple products using Air Drop is like cutting butter with knife. I feel it could be a little more flexible in this part.To conclude, It is a pricey phone which is loaded with so many many Features for any Power user or a 'Simple Average User' like me. After buying a phone all I want to do is just start using it without thinking about Lags, Call drops, Quality of the Photos and videos, Software updates, Internet speed, Performance, Battery Life, Screen, Durability, Life of the phone etc., In Short Never worry about the phone. Isn't that's what the purpose of a 'smart'phone is?!!If this is all you want then definitely go for the iPhone 6s because with iPhone everything 'Just Works''Happy Shopping :-)

Outstanding Performance. Design not crafted carefully.
Cisco Networld
on 18 January 2016
Performance: 10/10Stability: 9/10Consistency: 10/10Looks: 7/10Sound: 9/10Camera: 9/10Design: 6/10Privacy Control: 10/10Battery Backup: 8/10Compatibility: 2/10Overall: 8 out of 10.(+) Apple indubitably reigns the rondure in performance, stability, privacy, and consistency. No lag, no abrupt reboots, no application hang, no leaking of personal information, and no malfunctions. Display is vivid and vibrant. This phone is loyal and brings user experience to the apex with hardware and software both perfectly aligned. Battery as well is good enough to sustain a day with 3-4 hours of multimedia, 3G/LTE, 3-4 hours of talktime. 3D touch is a good addition. Camera is not major improvement in quality from 5s but equipped with 4K.(-) Design and Looks both slides down. 4.7" is not operable by one hand. The phone is slim but crafted haphazardly giving users not the safe grip. The lens is exposed out of its base increasing risk and reducing life span. Apple can talk with only Apple devices, a major restriction but giving higher advantages of privacy and stability. Businessmen who need to send or check emails/text/notes/calendar on a go would stare at the designer. Space Grey is now lighter grey, another downside making the looks mediocre.Final say:Performance of 6/6s is outstanding as expected from Apple. However, changing the design to a radical degree doesn't prove a success as it was in case of 4s, 5, and 5s. I would definitely be contented with performance + design when paying a steep tag over 45K, and therefore can't call iPhone 6/6s the best choice. iPhone 5s at half the price of 6s can be an excellent choice except for a few specific users who need 6s for marginally better CPU and GPU; or for multimedia.TIPs:1) It's much better to visit nearby Apple / Reliance Digital / Crome store and check the phone. Type some text, hold the handset, check the preferred color. It will help making the decision.2) Put a protective cover, it would act as savior when you expect least. Spigen is one good option.3) Check the warranty of phone on Apple site to confirm the handset is new.4) Keep the warranty plan after one year. It's expensive but will prove worth of every bit by saving exponential repair cost.

Buyer is trustworthy and so is the service , whatever android fanboys say , this phone feels premium no matter what htc Samsung do they cannot match apple's integrity or looks , fanboys look at specs , but optimisation is the one which takes care of everything , and apple always deliver it. Those guys who say that this phone is overpriced , I can only say one thing " don't be jealous"

Replaced my 4 year old iPhone 4S with iPhone 6S.It is very fast and smooth in operation and gives more space to read and work when compared to 4S though larger to hold.Initially was uncomfortable with the size as I did prefer a phone no larger than 4 inch, but found it more comfortable to use than the smaller screen size phones. 3D touch is great to peep-in the messages.It is a great phone.

This Is the Best Phone I ve ever used... 3D touch is awsm... Compare To 6s plus, i prefferd 6s due to easy to handlng.... The Main Cons is The battery life.. I expect a better battery life than 6,unfortunately the battry life will be reduced in upgraded version..And Also i expect the base storage limit be 32GB in 6s ... Bt Am 100%/ Satisfied..Go for It

I ordered iPhone 6s on 5 th dec and it got delivered on 10th. Packaging was brilliant and Amazon delivery was also before date.Talking about the product, I got it at an amazing price of 49k from the seller Technoholic.Feeling of unpackaging the device is something in itself. I was able to set up the product within few minutes. And from then on it is working flawlessly.3D Touch and Live Photos are amazingly awesome. Touch and photos are brilliant. The phone feels premium when you hold it. Everything is brilliant about the phone. If you are planning to spend 59 k or so just go for this device.The con con which I felt is small storage option. With larger photo sizes etc 16 gb storage is just not enough. Out of 16 gb u get only 11.5 gb.Everything else about the phone is simply superb.

Abhishek
on 7 December 2015
Writing this review after Using my first IPhone 6s for good two months. Having switched from a Android phone it was difficult to get equipped to the IOS software, Performance with the new chip fantastic, Live Photos nothing can beat that, video Recording cant be better one killer part is the Music. I must have used at least 5 different android phone till date but nothing can beat the quality of the music on I-phone, no where close to it. WIFI works lighting fast.Well obviously there are certain limitation that you have to live with.1. Cant download music from other shared Link: this is overdone by the quality of music available on IPhone and there are other means of sharing the music onto the phone2. Truecaller does not work like the Android version3. Dail pad does not allows to search contact by typing there initials -  This was definitely a pain points initially but once you get use to fast speed of looking up faster in contact list this is not much of an Hurdle

This review is for Indian buyers. I won't go into the pros and cons of the device. However, as someone whose iPhone fell down, resulting in a broken screen - Beware ! Apple India does not allow part repair for screens - guess why? Because the Indian technicians are not trained enough !! Yes - that is the reason I got from the Apple Care Helpline.As a result while the rest of the world pays 109 dollars - about 7K from a new screen - Indians have to pay a whopping 25K minimum - no other options. Why minimum - because of phone has any other damage- the price goes up. However, on my insistence, the Apple care lady admitted that you could try having it serviced in another country where they do part repair - but no guarantees. There is no option to courier the device and have it repaired abroad either.To be forced to pay more than 50% of the cost of the phone for something than happens frequently with kids and slips from car dashboards, and especially considering the slippery iPhone screen and protruding camera slot in the back is nothing short of robbery. I would not have bought the phone had I seen this information

on 17 November 2015
I m using apple iPhone 6 & probably it will be my last iPhone . as apple is making fools to Indians. As per lot of people in above reviews iPhone 6s is expensive due to taxes , people are not able to afford due to which people are writing negative review . but I m currently iPhone userDo u want to understand why???? IPhone 6 will be last iPhone I will be using .1) taxes & import duty are same for all importers.( Samsung/Google/apple)2)nexus 6PP 32gb sold in US at 500$ in India 40K when u will convert in dollars it will be 615$. I can understand 100$ taxes3 iPhone 6plus 16gb sold in US at 750$ in India 72K when convert in dollar 1105$ . here I can't understand why 350 $ more for taxes in India . is taxes different for iPhone??.

New iPhone 6s:
Amazon Customer
on 16 November 2015
You could shoot better pictures. The new 6s phones have a 12-megapixel rear-facing iSight camera, which Apple says will create brighter and clearer stills and video. This is an improvement over the 8-megapixel rear camera in the iPhone 6. (The limitations of that camera can be clearly seen in the washed-out details of images.) front-facing (or “selfie”) camera also gets an upgrade with the iPhone 6s. The new phones ship with a 5-megapixel front-facing camera, a decided improvement over the 1.2-megapixel camera in the iPhone 6.3D Touch is actually pretty useful. The new iPhone 6s and 6s Plus offer a new input feature called 3D Touch and haptic feedback. It’s a touchscreen technology that can detect various types of user touch. A “3D Touch” is a long finger-press on the screen that conveys a different message to the operating system than a light tap or a normal touch. The screen then responds with haptic feedback — a tap — that gives you the illusion you’ve pressed down on a physical button.phone will run faster. The iPhone 6s and 6s Plus are powered by Apple’s new 64-bit A9 processor, which Apple says can render graphics up to 90 percent faster than earlier chips. The increased processing power, Apple said, will be most readily apparent in gameplay and video playback. The M9 motion co-processor is baked directly into the chipset in the phone to power things like health apps and Siri.The iPhone 6 may offer some users faster wireless connection speeds. There’s a new antenna system inside the device that can theoretically (in the lab) produce LTE Advanced download speeds up to 300 Mbps. And a new 802.11ac Wi-Fi radio with multiple antennas could pump up Wi-Fi speeds.ConsIt’s an expensive phone. Unlike many Android players, Apple has been able to stick to its premium price points for devices. And I mean premium.

This is the first and most probably last time that I would ever consider buying anything from Amazon!The delivery was great and I managed to surprise my wife with a great phone, but nevertheless, a defect detected by my wife was found and I had to cancel as replacement of the product would've taken close to a weeks time.My advise would be to offer a faster and more effective turn around time to replace the product to maintain a healthy customer relationship.I do hope no one else has such an experience!

Pankaj B
on 11 November 2015
Kindly ignore all the haters and fraudsters who are trying to get their money back just because it got pricecut but they do not understand that prices are not high due to apple decision, it's due to Indian govt, that charges high fees/taxes on imports and apple is not a asian manufacturer so their shipping cost might be high as compared to other Chinese/korean manufacturers. Blackberry priv is coming with the price tag of 60,000 and even passport came with 50k price in starting so all of you little whiners if you need a cheap phone buy a xiaomi. As for this phone it's a beauty.You can't get apple kind of build quality, software and hardware in any phone. It's a high end product which will work fine for several years and remember you are paying more money for after service support, free replacement. You can't get those things with any android manufacturer. Just for a example You can see iPhone 4s (It's a 2011 device) and  It's still getting latest ios updates from apple. Kindly tell me one phone that you bought in 50k-60k in 2011 which is getting updates from their manufacturer.

Can't be considered a flagship
SUSHANT VERMA
on 4 November 2015
With missing many practical features of convenience, we can't consider iPhone 6S a flagship. I've been seriously considering for upgrade but these missing feature really make me think hard:1. Missing Optical Image Stabilization.2. Missing Full HD display.3. 16 GB  memory; though I don't keep songs and videos but still it should not complain about "no space" for just a week long adventures where don't want to take a DSLR,  it's like a 5 star hotel is doing cost cutting on sanitary.4. Fast charging and wireless charging, cables are real pain for a techie having many devices.3. NFC, cross device collaboration is important unless it is meant only for noobs.6. Mono speaker, small battery, big bezel etc. not much to crib about but seriously items, where are the flagship attention to details.Dear Apple, get out of the catch-up game and do something what you've done before.

Parth Rawal
on 1 November 2015
This is the best smartphone in the market. People who are rating 1 to 3 star are people who actually done even have the iPhone in their hands. It's not Apple's fault that the prices are too high. It's the government taxes that make the prices this high. Secondly, Amazon should only let people who have bought the product review the product as most of the reviews are useless as you need to review the product not the price of it and if you don't possess the product you shouldn't review it at all.

"WHAT'S CHANGED IS EVERYTHING" SAYS APPLE..LETS SEE!
Kanwar Anand
on 28 October 2015
People are saying that the iPhone 6s looks exactly the same as the iPhone 6. Apple is quoting "Everything has changed." Time for me to put my investigative gloves on and see what really has changed since the previous generation. You can call these changes superficial and say they don't add any utility but trust you me, every single thing that Apple changes, it sticks to..there is a reason they are the most profitable company in the world. But my fellow Indian, lets see if this change is worth the Rs 7000 (on amazon at least) difference, shall we start then ?!=====Hardware Changes=====1) 3D TOUCH - Useful when you are taking a photo. Push the screen down on the Camera button and get four options, to choose a selfie, to take a video to take a picture and to record slow mo.2) THICKER - The iPhone 6s is 143 grams. To incorporate the 3D Touch Mechanism and the Aluminum 7000 Series these changes were made. The result is a thicker phone which is 14 grams heavier than the previous generation but one that is definitely more grippy, the added weight is a good weight. Its like gaining muscle weight as opposed to fat.3) 12 MEGAPIXEL CAMERA / 5 MEGAPIXEL FF CAMERA - Yes the camera has finally got an upgrade. You can also shoot 4K video now. Is this noticeable? Let me just say that never before in an Iphone generation upgrade has such little change been noticed. I used both the phones and the difference is so little really. The front facing camera has definitely improved by say 12%. Im not saying its bad, its just not that big a difference like they were touting. The retina flash is a new technology where the Apple iPhone's screen becomes 3 times as bright as usual to give you a great flash. Is this good? Far from it in my limited experience4) SPEAKER - Louder, crisper and more substantial than ever before. I noticed a 20% improvement in both clarity and loudness.5) FASTER TOUCH ID - Yes, its a little faster now. Big deal..6) BATTERY LIFE - Battery on the iPhone 6 was a major improvement from iPhone 5s. Similarly the battery on the 6s is acceptable and satisfactory. If you live your life on an iPhone and have no computer, I suggest you get the 6s Plus. Some tests report 2-3 days standby. Easy 24 hours with the 6s.7) 2GB RAM - Yes now you have 2GB RAM. What does this mean in real terms? Seldom will pages take time to reload. Improved memory management.Summary of hardware changes - iPhone 6/6S both have the same pixel density. They have 326ppi. I wish they had improved on this. Apple is really slow on the uptake of these changes. The added weight is ok.=====Software Changes=====1) The camera now takes LIVE PHOTOS - This is a very cool thing because it only happens on the 6s.No noticeable differences in load times, multitasking is meant to be better because they improved ram. The WiFi reception is improved marginally.That sums it up. There is no major difference than the iPhone 6. iOS 9 is horrible but you know that already.===CONCLUSION===If you have the iPhone 6, dont buy the 6s at any cost.Any thing later than that, it all depends on your budget.The 6S is really no big deal to put it simply.Other alternatives? S6 Edge and the 6/6s Plus

MOHAN LAL

By putting higher price tag apple played  -ve game. Idealy apple should have kept the price may be same as iphone 6 and iphone 6 price should have been reduced as model is already more that a year old. the customers buying older model should definitely get price benefit. I have been using apple iphone 4s from last three years so far my experience has been great except my wifi doesn't work now and pulling on as it is. Apples higher pricing has forced me continue with 4s otherwise would have bought latest model. Not only me apple has forced millions to continue with older models leaving middle market to be captured by other manufecturers.
